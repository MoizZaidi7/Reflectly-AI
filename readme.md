ðŸ§  Mental Health Journal with AI Insights

A MERN-stack web application that helps users maintain a personal mental health journal, track emotions over time, and (in later phases) receive AI-powered insights and suggestions for improving well-being.

Currently, the project includes secure authentication, journaling features, and an interactive frontend dashboard.

ðŸš€ Project Summary

The Mental Health Journal with AI Insights is designed to help individuals reflect on their daily emotions through journaling.

Users can sign up / log in securely using JWT authentication.

Add, edit, and delete journal entries.

View past entries in a clean dashboard interface.

(Upcoming) AI integration will detect emotions from text and suggest coping strategies.

(Upcoming) Analytics dashboard will show emotion trends and patterns.

This project demonstrates full-stack web development (MERN) with modern UI (React + Tailwind) and later includes AI/NLP integration â€” making it a strong portfolio project.
